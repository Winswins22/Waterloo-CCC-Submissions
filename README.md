# Waterloo-CCC-Submissions
My AC submissions for questions/problems that are related to the Waterloo CCC.
I am adding explanations for the algorithm used in the code, which hopefully halps you debug your code :)).

Most submissions will be Python 3 or C++, but there are a couple Turing and Lua submissions too.

All submissions were lifted from my DMOJ profile: https://dmoj.ca/user/Winswins/solved
