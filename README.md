# Waterloo-CCC-Submissions
My AC submissions for questions/problems that are related to the Waterloo CCC.
I have added explanations for the algorithm used in the code, which hopefully helps you debug your code :)).

Most submissions will be Python 3 or C++, but there are a couple Turing and Lua submissions too.
Note that you cannot use Turing or Lua during the CCC. They are for reference only.

All submissions were lifted from my DMOJ profile: https://dmoj.ca/user/Winswins/solved
