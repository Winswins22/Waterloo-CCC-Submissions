For this question, you'll want to know the basics of graphs, as it'll make this question easier.

You'll want to contruct 2 directed graphs, one where edges point towards taller people and another
where edges point towards shorter people.

Traverse from one person to another through the taller graph. If it can be reached, they are taller.
Do the same with the shorter graph. If neither graph can be used to connect the two, it is unknown.
