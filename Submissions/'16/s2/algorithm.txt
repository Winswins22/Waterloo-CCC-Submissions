You can read input by using a list/vector.

To solve question 1, you'll want to pair the fastest speed person from one side and slowest speeds 
from the other side. This makes it so that the faster person can carry the other slower person.
This can be achieved by sorting both lists and using for loop(s) to get the speeds in the list.

To solve question 2, you'll want to pair the people with the closest speeds together. This makes
it so that the speed benefit is as low as possible. This can be achieved by sorting both lists 
and using a for loop to loop through both lists at the same time.
