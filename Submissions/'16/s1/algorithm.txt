Count the amount of each letter in each string. You can loop through all the letters and store
the amounts with a dict/map.

For 8/15 marks, simply compare if the maps/dicts are equal.
For the rest of the marks, get the amount of different characters between the two 
(excluding asterisks) and see if the amount of different characters is less or equal to the amount
of asterisks.
