You can do this question without a nested list, but it's more clear so I used it in my code.

The idea of a nested list is to use a list to store lists. 
You can use the first index to store each row, and the second index to get the 
number inside the row.

To initialize the nested list, you'll need to add as many spaces as the input says and then use a 
counter variable to store the day, making sure you stop adding to the list after it hits 7 days.

In the sample output, a way to store the calendar would be:
[
[(None), (None), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26],
[27, 28, 29, 30]
]
