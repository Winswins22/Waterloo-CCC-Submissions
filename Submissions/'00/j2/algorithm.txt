For this question, you'll want to use a for loop to loop through all the numbers, and use a counter
to keep track of how many numbers can be reversed.

Inside the for loop, you'll need to check one number at a time from 0 .. halfway, while also 
checking the other side.

For example, if we were checking the number 16891:

1: Check if start and end are the same after reversal
   - 1 and 1 are reversable, continue

2: Check start + 1 and end - 1 are the same after reversal
   - 6 and 9 are reversable

3: Check start + 2 and end - 2 are the same after reversal
   - 8 and 8 are reversable

Since it passed through, it must be a reversable number. 
If the number failed any of those checks, it cannot be reversed.
