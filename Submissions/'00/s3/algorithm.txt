For this question, you'll need to output the edges of the graph, and then check if two websites 
are connected.

To get the edges, you'll need to look for <A HREF="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc00s3">. That means 
that there is an edge between the current website and the linked website. Store this in a variable
so that you can use it to check if two websites are connected later. 

Common ways to store a graph would be using an adjacency list, edge list, or adjacency matrix.

After that, you'll need to implement a Depth FIrst Search or Breadth First Search to check if 
websites are connected. 

You can find a basic introduction here for Depth FIrst Search and Breadth First Search:
