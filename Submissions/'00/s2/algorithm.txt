For this question, you'll need to keep track of a stream and some variables for split and joins.

Some things to keep in mind:

You'll need store your numbers as decimals and round them as you output. I think the last case
requires you to do this, while the other 4 cases only use integers.


When the question says "left" and "right", "left" means moving to the left in the stream list
and "right" means moving to the right in the list.

For exmaple:

[10, 20, 30]
with a split at position 2 for 20% would output:

[10, 4, 16, 30]
