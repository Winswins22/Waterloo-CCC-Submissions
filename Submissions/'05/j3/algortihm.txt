While taking in instructions, record the OPPOSITE of what you get. For example:
L
SCHOOL
Record "RIGHT" and "SCHOOL" instead of left, because you need to turn the opposite way when heading
home.

Additionally, you'll want to reverse the order of the instructions, since you need to start at the
last street you used to get to school.
