Fairly straightforward question with a while loop and min() + max() or if statements.

The first input is the maximum x and y coordinates, with the rest being mouse movements.
The mouse starts at (0, 0) and input terminates when the input is (0, 0).

You can prevent the mouse from moving outside the allowed coordinates by using the min() and max()
functions or you can use some if statements.
