This question uses a Breadth First Search, with the twist that you move in an "L" shape instead of
adjacent tiles.

You can find an introduction for Breadth First Search here:

To get new positions, you can use 2 different arrays, one for vertical movement and the other for 
horizontal movement. You can loop through both arrays, and add the values to the current row/col
to get all new positions.
