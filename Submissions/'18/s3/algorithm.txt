You can find an introduction for Breadth First Search here:

For the first 5 marks, you'll need to implement a BFS to search through all the dots and store the
results of your search so that it can be outputted later on.

For another 5 marks, you'll want to implement cameras. You can move in all 4 directions (up, down,
left, right) and either keep track of the tiles the camera is watching or change all the tiles it
can see into walls.

For the final 5 marks, you'll need to take into account both cameras and conveyors. Cameras can't
see the robot when they are on the conveyor, and can see past the conveyor. To find the end
location for each conveyor, use a recursive function to travel along the conveyors. Keep note of
the conveyors that have been previously visited and make sure you don't visit them again, as you 
don't want to enter an infinite loop.
