You can use a nested list to store the cards or multiple lists, either is fine for this question.

After that, you loop through each list and check two items:
	- the elements inside the list
	- the length of the list

To check the elements inside the list, you can use a for loop to check throught the list, adding
points if you see a "A", "K", "Q", or "J".

After that, you can check the length of the list. If the length is less than 3, you add points as well.

Then, you can output the points, add the points to a total, and repeat for the other lists.

Finally, you can output the total amount of points.
