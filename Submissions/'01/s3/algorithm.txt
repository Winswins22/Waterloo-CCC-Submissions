For this question, you can use a variable to store the graph, and a list to store all the edges
in the graph.

Common ways to store a graph would be using an adjacency list, edge list, or adjacency matrix.

After that, you can loop through all the edges, select an edge to be bombed, and use a 
Depth First Search or a Breadth First Search to check if you can move from A to B without using
that edge.

You can find a basic introduction here for Depth FIrst Search and Breadth First Search:
