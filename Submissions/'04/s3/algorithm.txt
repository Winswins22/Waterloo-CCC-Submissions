This question requires you to detect specific cycles in a graph, but there is a way to do it without
building a proper cycle detection algorithm in this case.

Notice that the largest possible length of a given operation would have to go through every other
cell one at a time, which means the longest path is 9 * 10 cells long.

Because of this observation, we can loop through every cell 9 * 10 times each in order, and check if
we can get the result of that cell in that point of time (This means that all of its references are
integers or have already been solved). After 9 * 10 loops, if we still can't caluclate the answer
to a specific cell, it is not possible because of the observation above, and we can mark it with a *.
