For this question, it's helpful to use ASCII to save a bit of work.

In ASCII, A = 65, B = 66, ... Z = 90. Full table here: http://www.asciitable.com/

First, we need to read input and remove anything that is not a letter. If we convert the character
to an ASCII number and it is outside 65 to 90 (inclusive), we remove it.

After that, we can use a for loop with an extra counter to choose the next letter in the encrytion 
key to use. In the for loop, we add both the letters from the key and the phrase, subtract 65, and
if the number is higher than 90, we reduce it by 26 (to get back to "A", as it exceeded 90 ("Z")).
