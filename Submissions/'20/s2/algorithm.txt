For the first 3 marks, you can use brute force and a list/vector to calculate the result.

For the rest, you'll have to squeeze every bit of execution time out of your program, so here are
some general tips:
	- sets are faster than lists/vectors if you don't need indices
	- store your answer in a variable if you need to access it later. It is better than
	  recomputing your answer
	- you can mark a number as visited instead of a (row, col) pair to save space and time from
	  looping through the visited set
