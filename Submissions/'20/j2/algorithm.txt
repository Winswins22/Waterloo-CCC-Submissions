The first tree inputs give you the amount of people that need to be infected, 
the amount of people infected on day 0, and the amouont of people that one
person can infect.

The output will be the day on which the amount of people that needs to be infected
is less than the amount of people that are currently infected.

To keep track of all of this, you'll need to use a while/for loop to keep incrementing
the current days, a variable to track the total amount of infections, and a variable
to track the amount of people infected the last day.

Example:

20
6
2

Day TotalInfections PeopleInfectedYesterday
0   6               6
1   18              12
2   42              24

Edge Cases:


Sample Input 2:

Output the amount of days when the total amount of people infected are greater
than the amount of people that need to be infected, not when they are equal.

10

1

Output: 5


Day 0 Target:

When the amount of people that need to be infected has already occured on day 0.
