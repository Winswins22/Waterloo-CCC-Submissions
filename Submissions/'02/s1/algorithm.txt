For this question, you can use a for loop inside of multiple for loops - this is known as a "nested"
loop. You can use the nested loop to brute force the amount of tickets.

Set the upper bounds of the for loops to a high enough limit to test all possiblities and
keep track of how many you find. After that, you can output them when you find them.

Finally, output the total amount of tickets.
