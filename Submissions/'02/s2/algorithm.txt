After reading the numbers, you can divide the numerator by the denominator and then round that
number down to get the whole number.

To get the numerator after the division, use the equation:
numerator - (whole * denominator)

After that, you can simplify the numerator and denominator by checking for common factors. Using
a for loop to check for all combinations up to half the bigger number should be enough.

Remember to not output the whole if it is 0.
