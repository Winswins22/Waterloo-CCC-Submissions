This question is different from other Dijstrika's questions, since you need to find a balance
between a fast path and a path that keeps you alive.

Using a prioirity queue that prioritizes time, then health except in the case of the end node along
with a map that stores good paths that can be updated if either health or time is better ensures
that speed is prioritized, then health is taken into consideration when the end can't be reached
due to low health.
