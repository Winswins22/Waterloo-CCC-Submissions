For this question you can use Dijstrika's to solve it.

You can find an introduction for Dijstrika's here:

To start things off, notice that we can drive to the cities in any order. This is because if you
always use the most optimal paths to travel on, the maximum weight will be the same no matter
which order you travel in.

So, as long as you use Dijstrika's to pick the best path, you can always get the highest weight,
even if it means visiting nodes and edges more than once.

I've also noticed you can use Prim's as well to solve this problem.
