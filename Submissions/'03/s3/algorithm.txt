For this question, you'll want to get all the room sizes, and use the flooring to build the biggest
rooms first. 

To get the room sizes, you'll want to use a Breadth First Search or a Depth First Search to connect
the empty spaces together, and get the size.

You can find an introduction for Depth FIrst Search and Breadth First Search here:

After that, sort the room sizes so that the biggest rooms come first. Then, keep building the rooms
until you run out of flooring.
