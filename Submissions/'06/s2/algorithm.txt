In this problem, the first line is an unencrypted message, the second line is what the letters in 
the unecrypted message stand for, and in the third line is a completely seperate message that you
have to decrypt.

So if the input was:
HELLO
WERRT
RTR

Encrypted -> Decrypted
W : H
E : E
R : L
T : O

If we pass RTR though this, we get L-O-L.

To simulate this, using a map/dict is recommended. You can use the encrypted letters as the key
and the unencrypted letter as the value. If you can't retrieve the value from the key, mark it with
a ".".
