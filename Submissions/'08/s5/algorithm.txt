Memoization: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memoization-1d-2d-and-3d/

An interesting DP with multiple values to mess with.

To use memoization, you can start off by simulating what would happen at each turn with each
combination of particles and storing the results in a map/dict. The unique part is that Patrick 
and Roland will always choose the best choice for them. 

For example, if it is Patrick's turn, and he has 5 choices: Lose, Lose, Lose, Win, and Lose; he
will pick Win because Patrick will always choose the most optimal option.s
